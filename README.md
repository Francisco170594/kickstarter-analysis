- Averages (=ROUND(E2/D2*100,0))
- Trouble shooting (#DIV/0!) dividing by cero (=IFERROR(ROUND(E2/L2,2),0))

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
